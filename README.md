As an enterprise cloud management solution the idea of my cloud portal is to provide a single pane of glass for the user to Consume and Govern any service from any cloud. This cloud management solution can be used as a cloud broker, cloud gateway or a cloud control panel.
In its current state it enables users to consume, monitor and manage services from Eucalyptus private cloud & AWS public cloud (Amazon Web Services).
